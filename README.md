# DFNï¼šDistributed Feedback Network for Single-Image  Deraining

## Abstract 
Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have achieved great success for single-image deraining. However, affected by the intrinsic overlapping between rain streaks and background texture patterns, a majority of these methods tend to almost remove texture details in rain-free regions and lead to over-smoothing effects in the recovered background. To generate reasonable rain streak layers and improve the reconstruction quality of the background, we propose a distributed feedback network (DFN) in recurrent structure. A novel feedback block is designed to implement the feedback mechanism. In each feedback block, the hidden state with high-level information (output) will flow into the next iteration to correct the low-level representations (input). By stacking multiple feedback blocks, the proposed network where the hidden states are distributed can extract powerful high-level representations for rain streak layers. Curriculum learning is employed to connect the loss of each iteration and ensure that hidden states contain the notion of output. In addition, a self-ensemble strategy for rain removal task, which can retain the approximate vertical character of rain streaks, is explored to maximize the potential performance of the deraining model. Extensive experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with other deraining methods.

## Requirements

*Python 3.7,Pytorch >= 0.4.0  
*Requirements: opencv-python  
*Platforms: Ubuntu 18.04,cuda-10.2  
*MATLAB for calculating PSNR and SSIM 

## Datasets
DFN is trained and tested on five benchamark datasets: Rain100L[1],Rain100H[1],RainLight[2],RainHeavy[2] and Rain12[3]. It should be noted that DFN is trained on strict 1,254 images for Rain100H.

*Note: 

(i) The authors of [1] updated the Rain100L and Rain100H, we call the new datasets as RainLight and RainHeavy here.

(ii) The Rain12 contains only 12 pairs of testing images, we use the model trained on Rain100L to test on Rain12.

## Getting Started
### Test
All the pre-trained models were placed in `./logs/`.

Run the `test_DFN.py` to obtain the deraining images. Then, you can calculate the evaluation metrics by run the MATLAB scripts in `./statistics/`. For example, if you want to compute the average PSNR and SSIM on Rain100L, you can run the `Rain100L.m`.

### Train
If you want to train the models, you can run the `train_DFN.py` and don't forget to change the `args` in this file. Or, you can run in the terminal by the following code.

`python train_DFN.py --save_path path_to_save_trained_models  --data_path path_to_training_dataset`

### Results

Average PSNR and SSIM values of DFN on five datasets are shown:
